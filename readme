BrowserPilot uses GPT-4 to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf.

There are two versions of this project:

### 1. Chrome Extension

A chrome extension is easy installable in existing  Chrome browser. It uses GPT-4 to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf.
It is mainly helpful where login in required and you have already logged in in your current browser.

### 2. Puppeteer Agent

A puppeteer agent is a standalone application that uses GPT-4 to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf.
It is mainly helpful where login in not required as it opens new chromium tab on every request.
It is also helpful in running headless browser.
