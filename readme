# BrowserPilot: Automate Your Browsing with GPT-4  
  
BrowserPilot is a powerful tool that uses GPT-4 to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf. There are two versions of this project:  
  
## 1. Chrome Extension  
- The Chrome extension is easily installable in your existing Chrome browser.
- It utilizes GPT-4 to automate your browsing, making it particularly useful for tasks that require login credentials.  
  
## 2. Puppeteer Agent  
- The Puppeteer agent is a standalone application that also leverages GPT-4 to control your browser.
- It is especially helpful for tasks that do not require login, as it opens a new Chromium tab for each request.
- Additionally, it is capable of running a headless browser.
